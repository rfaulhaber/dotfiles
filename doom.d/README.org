#+TITLE: Emacs config

This is my Emacs configuration. This directory is symlinked to =~/.doom.d= on
every computer I use.

Emacs, for me, is my:

- IDE
- Text editor
- Mail client
- Notebook
- Terminal emulator
- REPL environment
- Spreadsheet application
- File explorer

In short, for any task that requires editing text, I use Emacs for that.

Further, this configuration uses the wonderful [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] framework.

* Files
- =init.el=: boilerplate configuration for Doom Emacs. Enables a series of
  packages by default with default config
- =config.el=: my own personal config on top of Doom Emacs
- =packages.el=: additional packages beyond what Doom provides
- =scripts/self.el=: my own personal Emacs code, stuff that's too short to be
  its own module proper
  + TODO make =self= module
- =scripts/org-templates.el=: my Org / org-roam capture templates
