#+title: nix

I use [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]]. This is my system configuration.

- =hosts= is where the actual individual system configurations live. You'll find
  a configuration for each machine I use Nix on.
- =lib= is my Nix code library, mostly lifted from other places.
- =modules= are my actual system modules.
- =templates= are Nix templates used by =nix flake init=.
- =overlays= contains personal overlays for nixpkgs. I don't have many of those.
- =formats= and =installers= are for nixos-generate.
