#+title: Moving atlas to ZFS

At the time of writing this, I'm working on converting =atlas= to utilize ZFS and raidz2 parity rather than SnapRAID and MergerFS.
This should result in a more fault-tolerant system.

This process will utilize [[https://github.com/nix-community/disko][disko]] for expediency and consistency.

* Phases
** Phase 1
- Format 12TB disks, root
- Manually move =/data= to new pool
** Phase 2
- Format existing 8TB disks
- Add to pool
