#+TITLE: Atlas

~atlas~ is my home server. It runs a minimal, non-GUI installation of this NixOS configuration.

My home server has three components:

- SnapRAID (for pooly-utilized backup)
- MergerFS (for creating a data pool from the 8 hard drives)
- Docker

The services hosted by my server are essentially one big Docker Compose file
(not hosted). NixOS handles all the underlying hardware and system configuration.
