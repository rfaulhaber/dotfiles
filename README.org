#+TITLE: dotfiles

These are my somewhat poorly structured dotfiles, containing everything I would
need for my Mac or Linux environments, with my Mac dotfiles only being a subset
of my Linux dotfiles.

This repo is currently undergoing a massive restructuring. I'm attempting to
rewrite all my config files using Nix. In the ideal world, my config should be
as simple as flipping a few switches per host.

I would like to tell you how to use Nix better, but as Newton said, "If I have
seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." Much of my config is
very heavily based on [[https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles][these]] [[https://git.sr.ht/~dunklecat/nixos-config/tree][configs]].
