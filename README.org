#+TITLE: dotfiles

These are all the configuration files I use across every computer I use for
development. For all development I use either Linux or Mac explicitly, and these
configuration files assume such.

My configuration is broken down into mostly two parts: System (mostly Linux)
configuration and Emacs configuration.

I publish this here in the hopes that someone might find it useful. If you find
this configuration useful, or have any questions, please let me know.

* Emacs
[[https://ryanfaulhaber.com/posts/try-emacs/][I use Emacs]] as my default editor. I use Emacs for any task that involves text.
* Nix
My Linux distro of choice (after going through about a dozen distros in my time
with Linux) is [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]].

The =nix= directory contains modules, which are pre-configured "switches" that
are flipped on and off in configurations under the =nix/hosts= directory. This
allows for a completely reproducible system. The idea with structuring my Nix
configuration in this manner is that I could theoretically use it to more easily
build configurations for other computers that run NixOS.

I would like to tell you how to use Nix better, but as Newton said, "If I have
seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." Much of my config is
very heavily based on [[https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles][these]] [[https://git.sr.ht/~dunklecat/nixos-config/tree][configs]].
